/*
Expected Result:
You selected Jeeping, what a thrill
AND
You did not select skiing

HERES WHY
Because the if else statement about Jeeping met the condition the
console log about selecting Jeeping occurred. 
Because the selected thrill was not skiing the statement 'You did not 
select skiing was executed*/
